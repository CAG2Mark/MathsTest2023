            <h2>Entering answers</h2>
            <p>
                For every question, you should input your answer into the answer box below the question
                prompt. Depending on the question, you may need to enter a function/expression in terms
                of variables/constants provided by the question, or you may need to enter an exact
                number.
            </p>
            <p>
                The input field can function like a mini-calculator; it understands common constants
                and functions. It will show you a preview of your parsed answer as you type, and will
                display an approximation of your answer when the answer is an exact number.
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, if your answer does not have an exact decimal representation,
                you must type in the exact answer (in terms of
                \(\cos, \sin, e, \pi, \text{etc.}\)). The precision used your answer is checked to is greater than
                that of most calculators. For example, if the answer is \(e^{\cos 2}\), you must not enter your answer
                as <span class="mono">0.65958</span>,
                but instead something like <span class="mono">e^cos(2)</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The functions you may use can be found here:
                <a href="https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/functions.html">functions</a>,
                <a href="https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/constants.html">constants</a>.
                Not all of these will work in the input field, but simple elemetary functions
                and common constants should work. To use \(\pi\) for example, simply type
                <span class="mono">pi</span>. To calculate \(\cos(1)\), simply enter
                <span class="mono">cos(1)</span>. Note that all trigonometric and
                hyperbolic functions use radians as both of their input and output units.
            </p>
            <p>The following manually added / renamed functions are also available:
            <ul class="mono">
                <li>arcsin(x)</li>
                <li>arccos(x)</li>
                <li>arctan(x)</li>
                <li>arcsinh(x)</li>
                <li>arccosh(x)</li>
                <li>arctanh(x)</li>
                <li>ln(x)</li>
                <li>nCr(n,r)</li>
                <li>nPr(n,r)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you use undefined constants or functions, it may not error
                until you submit your answers at the end, which is when
                answers are checked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also note that it is your responsibility to determine whether the answer
                should be a numerical value or a function when such information not explicitly specified.
                The questions give you enough information to discern whether the answer
                is in terms of constants and variables from the question, or whether it is
                a numerical value.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Your answers will be saved between sessions.</b>
            </p>
            <h2>Submitting answers</h2>
            <p>
                Apart from the tutorial questions, your answers will not be checked as
                you type them. This is to prevent brute-forcing the answer to each
                individual question. Moreover, the system is designed so that it can only
                tell if <it>all</it> the answers are correct up up to a checkpoint; even the system does not know
                whether you are right until all answers up to a checkpoint are correct.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if there is an error evaluating a certain answer you inputted,
                then you will be told which question that was so you can correct it.
